About the project
- This project is about building word2vec using skipgram logic to measure word similarity and to find the root word of morphology.
- Training data is movie review data
- Word similairty is measured by computing cosine similarities of two word vectors.
- Morphology form of the word(e.g. words with less,ing, un, est). Learned about the vector of morph(subtract the mophology and the root word)
and then, the root word is predicted given the mophology using the vector arithmetic.
